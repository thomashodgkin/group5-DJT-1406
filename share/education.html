            	    <p>Traditionally an <strong>orchestra</strong> is a large instrumental ensemble used in classical music that contains sections of <strong>string</strong> <em>(violin, viola, cello and double bass)</em>, <strong>brass</strong>, <strong>woodwind</strong>, and <strong>percussion</strong> instruments. Other instruments such as the <strong>piano</strong> and <strong>celesta</strong> may sometimes be grouped into a <em>fifth section</em> such as a <strong>keyboard</strong> section or may stand alone, as may the <strong>concert harp</strong> and, for 20th and 21st century compositions, electric and electronic instruments. The term orchestra derives from the <strong>Greek</strong> name for the area in front of an ancient Greek stage reserved for the Greek chorus. The orchestra grew by accretion throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, but <em>changed very little</em> in composition during the course of the <em>20th century</em>. <br><br>
                    <em>There are also a variety of amateur orchestras:</em></p>

<ul><li><strong><em>School orchestras:</em></strong> These orchestras consist of students from an elementary or secondary school. They may be students from a music class or program or they may be drawn from the entire school body. School orchestras are typically led by a music teacher.</li><br>
<li><strong><em>University or conservatory orchestras</em>:</strong> These orchestras consist of students from a university or music conservatory. In some cases, university orchestras are open to all students from a university, from all programs. </li><br>
<li><strong><em>Youth orchestras:</em></strong> These orchestras consist of teens and young adults drawn from an entire city or region. In some cases, youth orchestras may consist of teens or young adults from an entire country (e.g., Canada's National Youth Orchestra).</li><br>
<li><strong><em>Community orchestras:</em></strong> These orchestras consist of amateur performers drawn from an entire region or city. Community orchestras typically consist mainly of adult amateur musicians. Community orchestras range in level from intermediate-level ensembles to fairly advanced amateur groups. In some cases, university or conservatory students may also be members of community orchestras. While community orchestra members are mostly amateurs, in some orchestras, a small number of professionals may be hired to act as principal players and section leaders.</li></ul><br>

				<h2><a name="conductor"/>The Conductor</h2>
					<img src="Images/education/conductor.jpg" class="floatright" width="300" height="" alt="The Conductor"/>
                    <p>Primarily the role of the conductor in an orchestra is to keep everyone together. During rehearsals, the conductor is responsible for determining how the music will be interpreted and for noticing and correcting any errors in how the musicians are performing. Usually, the conductor also chooses the repertoire of the orchestra for each concert or
concert season.</p>
					<p>Conducting is the art of directing a <em>musical performance</em>, such as an <em>orchestral or choral concert</em>, by way of visible gestures with the hands, arms, face and head. The primary duties of the conductor are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats (meter), and to<strong> listen critically</strong> and shape the sound of the ensemble.</p>

<p>The conductor typically stands on a <strong>raised podium</strong> and he or she may or may not use a <em>baton</em>. In the 2010s, most conductors do not play an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In <strong><em>Baroque</em></strong> music from the 1600s to the 1750s, conductors performing in the 2010s may lead an ensemble while playing a <em>harpsichord</em> or the <em>violin</em>. Conducting while playing a piano may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras. Communication is typically <strong>non-verbal</strong> during a performance <em>(this is strictly the case in art music, but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions)</em>. However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.</p><br>

              <p>The typical <strong>symphony orchestra</strong> consists of four groups of related musical instruments called the <em>woodwinds, brass, percussion, and strings (violin, viola, cello and double bass)</em>. Other instruments such as the <em>piano</em> and <em>celesta</em> may sometimes be grouped into a <strong>fifth section</strong> such as a <em>keyboard</em> section or may stand alone, as may the concert <em>harp and electric and electronic instruments</em>. The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group. In the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period and <strong>Ludwig van Beethoven's</strong> influence on the classical model. In the 20th century, new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation of the orchestra, resulting in a <em>flexible use of the classical model instruments</em> in various combinations.</p>
